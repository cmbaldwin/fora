# Fora - Extension of Simple Discussion

A fork of Simple Discussion that's less simple. Updated and designed for Ruby 3+, Rails 6+ (out-of-the-box support for ActionText/trix), Bootstrap 5. The short term goal is one click deployability on Heroku.

As with Simple Discussion, this requires an Devise. Read installation instructions below.
